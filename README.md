# MagneticClassifier

Magnetic-Inspired Classifier, a approach inspired by magnetic forces, to optimize classification tasks
his concept involves simulating attractive and repulsive forces between class centers, mimicking the behavior of magnetic poles to improve classification accuracy.

Key Insights:
Magnetic-Inspired Classifier: The algorithm applies attractive forces to bring similar class points closer and repulsive forces to push apart different classes, simulating magnetic interactions.
Challenges & Progress: While the Magnetic-Inspired Classifier showed promise, it faced challenges in outperforming established models like SVM. However, with proper tuning of hyperparameters such as learning rate, epochs, magnetic strength, and repulsion strength, performance improved significantly.
